# Phase 3 - Backend Système de Guesses - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation completes **Phase 3, Section 3** of the project roadmap: Backend - Système de Guesses (Guess System).

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Type Definitions (contracts package)

Added new types to `packages/contracts/index.d.ts`:

- **MakeGuessRequest**: Request payload for making a guess
  - `playerId`: ID of the player making the guess
  - `targetPlayerId`: ID of the player being guessed about
  - `targetCharacterId`: ID of the character being guessed

- **GuessResultResponse**: Response containing guess result details
  - Includes guess metadata, correctness, game status, and winner info

- **SocketGuessResultEvent**: Socket.IO event payload for broadcasting guess results

- **ServerToClientEvents**: Extended with `guessResult` event

### 2. Backend Service Layer

#### GameService (apps/backend/src/game/game.service.ts)

Added `makeGuess()` method with comprehensive validation:

**Validations:**
- Game must exist and be in `in_progress` status
- Guessing player must exist and not have left the game
- Target player must exist and not have left the game
- Players cannot guess their own character
- Target character must belong to the game's character set
- Target player must have a secret character assigned
- An active round must exist

**Game Logic:**
- Checks if guess is correct by comparing with target player's secret character
- **If correct**: 
  - Updates game status to `completed`
  - Reveals target player's secret
  - Records winner
- **If incorrect**:
  - Marks guessing player as eliminated (leftAt timestamp)
  - Checks if only one player remains
  - If yes, completes game (last player standing wins)

### 3. Backend Controller Layer

#### GameController (apps/backend/src/game/game.controller.ts)

Added `POST /games/:roomCode/guesses` endpoint:
- Validates request parameters
- Calls `GameService.makeGuess()`
- Broadcasts `guessResult` event via GameGateway
- Returns guess result response

### 4. WebSocket Gateway

#### GameGateway (apps/backend/src/game/game.gateway.ts)

Added `broadcastGuessResult()` method:
- Broadcasts `guessResult` event to all players in the game room
- Includes complete guess result information
- Logs broadcast for monitoring

### 5. Module Configuration

#### GameModule (apps/backend/src/game/game.module.ts)

- Added `Guess` entity to TypeORM feature imports
- Ensures Guess repository is available for dependency injection

### 6. Comprehensive Unit Tests

Added 14 new unit tests to `game.service.spec.ts`:

**Success Cases:**
1. Correct guess completing the game
2. Incorrect guess eliminating the guessing player
3. Last player standing wins after incorrect guess

**Error Cases:**
1. Game not found (NotFoundException)
2. Game not in progress (BadRequestException)
3. Guessing player not found (NotFoundException)
4. Guessing player has left (BadRequestException)
5. Target player not found (NotFoundException)
6. Target player has left (BadRequestException)
7. Player tries to guess themselves (BadRequestException)
8. Target character not found (NotFoundException)
9. Character not in game's character set (BadRequestException)
10. Target player has no secret (InternalServerErrorException)
11. No active round found (InternalServerErrorException)

**Test Results:** All 137 tests passing (increased from 123)

### 7. Documentation

Created comprehensive API documentation in `docs/guesses-api.md`:
- Endpoint specifications
- Request/response formats
- Error codes and messages
- Validation rules
- Game flow description
- Usage examples

## Quality Checks

✅ **Linting**: No errors  
✅ **Build**: Successful  
✅ **Tests**: 137/137 passing (100%)  
✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage  
✅ **Documentation**: Complete API docs  

## Integration Points

### Socket.IO Events

The guess system integrates with the existing Socket.IO infrastructure:

**New Event:**
- `guessResult` - Broadcast to all players when a guess is made

**Event Flow:**
1. Client calls POST /games/:roomCode/guesses
2. Server processes guess and updates game state
3. Server broadcasts `guessResult` event to all players in room
4. All clients receive real-time notification of guess result

### Database Schema

Uses existing entities:
- **Guess**: Stores all guess records (already existed)
- **Game**: Updated status when game completes
- **GamePlayer**: Updated leftAt when player eliminated
- **PlayerSecret**: Updated status/revealedAt when character revealed
- **Round**: Links guess to current round

### Game State Management

The guess system properly manages game state transitions:
- `in_progress` → `completed` (on correct guess)
- `in_progress` → `completed` (when one player remains)
- Player elimination (marking leftAt timestamp)
- Secret revelation (updating PlayerSecret status)

## Usage Example

```bash
# Make a guess
POST /games/ABC12/guesses
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "playerId": "player-1-uuid",
  "targetPlayerId": "player-2-uuid",
  "targetCharacterId": "character-uuid"
}

# Response (correct guess)
{
  "id": "guess-uuid",
  "guessedBy": {
    "id": "player-1-uuid",
    "username": "Alice"
  },
  "targetPlayer": {
    "id": "player-2-uuid",
    "username": "Bob"
  },
  "targetCharacter": {
    "id": "character-uuid",
    "name": "Sherlock Holmes"
  },
  "isCorrect": true,
  "guessedAt": "2025-10-31T09:30:00.000Z",
  "gameStatus": "completed",
  "winnerId": "player-1-uuid"
}
```

## Next Steps

This implementation completes Phase 3, Section 3 (Backend - Système de Guesses) of the roadmap.

**Remaining Phase 3 tasks:**
1. ✅ Backend - Système de Questions (Section 1)
2. ✅ Backend - Système de Réponses (Section 2)
3. ✅ **Backend - Système de Guesses (Section 3) - COMPLETED**
4. Backend - Système de Rounds et Scoring (Section 4)
5. Frontend - Interface de Jeu (Section 5)
6. Frontend - Écran de Fin de Partie (Section 6)
7. Types et Contracts (Section 7)

## Security Considerations

- No authentication required at endpoint level (validated via playerId)
- All game state validated before processing guess
- Players cannot manipulate other players' states directly
- Socket.IO events properly scoped to game rooms
- All database operations use TypeORM for SQL injection protection

## Performance Considerations

- Single database transaction for guess creation and state updates
- Efficient use of Promise.all for parallel database operations
- Minimal data sent in Socket.IO events
- Proper indexing on database queries (leverages existing indexes)

## Maintainability

- Comprehensive unit test coverage (14 new tests)
- Clear separation of concerns (Service/Controller/Gateway)
- Well-documented API with examples
- Type-safe implementation using TypeScript
- Consistent error handling patterns
- Detailed logging for monitoring and debugging
