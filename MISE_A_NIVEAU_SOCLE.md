# Mise à niveau socle - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the foundation upgrade (mise à niveau socle) completed for the WhoIsIt project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Environment Variables Configuration ✅

#### Frontend Changes
- **Fixed `apps/frontend/lib/auth-api.ts`**: Changed from `process.env.API_URL` to `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
  - This fixes a critical issue where API_URL was not accessible in browser-side code
  - Now properly uses Next.js environment variable conventions
  
- **Updated `apps/frontend/.env`**: 
  - Removed the non-functional `API_URL` variable
  - Ensured `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is set to `http://localhost:4000`
  - Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL` configuration with proper comments

- **Updated `apps/frontend/.env.example`**: 
  - Same changes as `.env` to provide a proper template for developers

#### Documentation
- **Updated `README.md`**: Added step 3 explaining frontend environment configuration
- **Created `docs/environment-variables.md`**: Comprehensive guide covering:
  - Frontend and backend environment variable setup
  - Explanation of NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix requirement
  - Default values and fallbacks
  - CORS configuration notes
  - Common issues and troubleshooting
  - Development vs Production configurations

### 2. REST API Endpoints for Character Sets and Characters ✅

#### New Module: `character-sets`
Created a complete NestJS module for managing character sets:

**DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):**
- `CharacterSetResponseDto`: Response format for character set data
- `CharacterResponseDto`: Response format for character data
- `TraitValueResponseDto`: Response format for trait values on characters

**Service (`character-sets.service.ts`):**
- `findAll()`: List all character sets with character counts
- `findOne(id)`: Get a specific character set by ID
- `findCharacters(setId)`: Get all active characters in a set with their trait values

**Controller (`character-sets.controller.ts`):**
- `GET /character-sets`: List all character sets
- `GET /character-sets/:id`: Get a specific character set
- `GET /character-sets/:id/characters`: Get characters in a set with traits

**Module (`character-sets.module.ts`):**
- Registers the service and controller
- Imports necessary TypeORM repositories

#### Integration
- Added `CharacterSetsModule` to `app.module.ts`

### 3. Game Start Endpoint ✅

#### Game Service Enhancement
- Added `startGame(roomCode)` method to `game.service.ts`:
  - Validates game exists and is in lobby state
  - Requires at least 2 players
  - Checks that all players are ready
  - Updates game status to `in_progress`
  - Sets `startedAt` timestamp

#### Game Controller Enhancement
- Added `POST /games/:roomCode/start` endpoint to `game.controller.ts`:
  - Validates room code
  - Calls service to start the game
  - Returns updated game state

### 4. API Documentation ✅

Created comprehensive API documentation:

- **`docs/character-sets-api.md`**: 
  - Complete documentation for all character set endpoints
  - Request/response examples
  - Error responses
  - cURL and JavaScript/TypeScript usage examples

- **`docs/games-api.md`**:
  - Documentation for all game endpoints including the new start endpoint
  - Game status and player role explanations
  - Complete flow examples
  - Validation rules

## Testing & Validation

### Backend
- ✅ Backend builds successfully (`pnpm run build`)
- ✅ All game service tests pass (20/20 tests)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ⚠️ One pre-existing test failure in email service (unrelated to our changes)

### Frontend
- ✅ Environment variable changes properly implemented
- ✅ Code uses correct `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` variable
- ⚠️ Build fails due to network restrictions (can't access fonts.googleapis.com) - environment limitation, not code issue

## Impact & Benefits

### 1. Fixed Critical Bug
The environment variable fix resolves a critical issue where `process.env.API_URL` was undefined in browser-side code, which would have caused all authentication and API calls to fail.

### 2. Added Essential Functionality
The character sets API provides the foundation for:
- Game creation UI: selecting character sets
- Character browsing
- Game configuration based on available sets

### 3. Enabled Game Flow
The game start endpoint completes the basic game flow:
1. Create game (existing)
2. Join game (existing)
3. Mark players ready (existing)
4. **Start game (NEW)** ✅

### 4. Improved Documentation
Clear documentation helps:
- Frontend developers consume the API
- Backend developers understand the architecture
- New team members get up to speed quickly

## Next Steps

The foundation is now solid for the following work:

1. **Frontend lobby experience**: Create UI components that consume these endpoints
2. **Game mechanics**: Implement round/question/answer logic using the character sets
3. **Socket.IO authentication**: Protect WebSocket connections with JWT
4. **Advanced game features**: Use character traits for gameplay logic
